Food Delivery System using Graphs in C 

Given the source (Caf√© Aroma, in Goregaon) the program implements Dijkstra algorithm to find the minimum distance path from the multiple paths given, destinations being one of the given:
Borivali
Kandivali
Malad
Dahisar

User starts with entering :
Their name,
Number of items they want to order,
Entering the item code and size,
And ultimately the quantity.

The user can either order again or enter the destination. The time taken by different paths to reach the destination is displayed.. of which the path which takes minimum time is displayed.

Bill Amount is displayed and options to
Order again, 
Serve,
Display,
Exit Is displayed 

The same process will continue till the user chooses to exit. If multiples orders are made the program makes the serving according to first come first serve.
